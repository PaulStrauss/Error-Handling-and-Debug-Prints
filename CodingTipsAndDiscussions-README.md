# Coding-Tips-and-Discussions
## Standard ways of writing code for common situations and general discussion of my coding techniques and coding issues.

Like every programmer, I have my ways of handling common programming situations. I'll discuss my solutions here. You may not like my ways of doing things and that's OK. There is, after all, an artistic aspect to this profession and I am well-aware that there are more than one good and correct way to write any program. You may disagree with my way of doing something and that's OK, too. However, I'd like to hear how you handle that situation and if you have a better way, can I steal it?
