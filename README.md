# Error-Handling-and-Debug-Prints
MS Access Tools, Standard Error Handler and Debug Print Procedures

This file contains a single VBA module. It contains the procedures that I use to do standard error handling and a few rather simple tools to log and print variables for debugging. These procedures do use Access Objects but Late Binding is used so that References need not be set to use them.

The code is, I think pretty well documented in the comments.
